Once you're connected as Laurie with ssh, (see writeup1), simply do :
`fakeroot-tcp`
And, as asked in the subject, if you run `id` : 
```
root@BornToSecHackMe:~# id
uid=0(root) gid=0(root) groups=0(root),1003(laurie)
```
and you also have a promt where you can run `whoami`
```
root@BornToSecHackMe:~# whoami
root
```
